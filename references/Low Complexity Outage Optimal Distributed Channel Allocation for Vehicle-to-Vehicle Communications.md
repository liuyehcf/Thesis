Due to the potential of enhancing trafficsafety, protecting environment, and enabling new applications, vehicular communications, especially vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, has recently been receiving much attention. Because of both safety and non-safety real-time applications, V2V communications has QoS requirements on rate, latency, and reliability. How to appropriately design channel allocation is therefore a key MAC/PHY layer issue in vehicular communications. The QoS requirements of real-time V2V communications can be met by achieving a low outage probability and high outage capacity. In this paper, we first formulate the subchannel allocation in V2V communications into a maximum matching problem on random bipartite graphs. A distributed shuffling based Hopcroft-Karp (DSHK) algorithm will then be proposed to solve this problem with a sub-linear complexity ofO(N2/3),whereNis the number of subchannels. By studying the maximum matching generated by the DSHK algorithm on random bipartite graphs, the outage probabilities are derived in the high (two near vehicles) and low (two far away vehicles) SNR regimes, respectively. It is then demonstrated that the proposed method has a similar outage performance as the scenario of two communicating vehicles occupying Nsubchannels. By solving high degree algebraic equations, the outage capacity can be obtained to determine the maximum traffic rate given an outage probability constraint. It is also shown that the proposed scheme can take an advantage of small signaling overhead with only one-bit channel state information broadcasting for each subchannel.

由于提高交通安全性，保护环境和实现新应用的潜力，车辆通信尤其是车辆间通信（V2V）通信近来备受关注。由于安全和非安全的实时应用，V2V通信对速率，延迟和可靠性都有QoS要求。因此如何适当地设计信道分配是车载通信中关键的MAC / PHY层问题。实时V2V通信的QoS要求可以通过实现低中断概率和高中断容量来满足。在本文中，我们首先将V2V通信中的子信道分配问题转化为随机偶图的最大匹配问题。然后将提出一种基于分布式混洗的Hopcroft-Karp（DSHK）算法来解决这个问题，具有子线性复杂度为O（N2 / 3），其中N是子信道的数量。通过研究随机二部图上DSHK算法产生的最大匹配，分别在高（两个近车）和低（两个远方车辆）SNR情况下推导出中断概率。然后证明该方法具有与两个通信车辆占用N个子信道相似的中断性能。通过求解高阶代数方程组，可以获得中断容量，以确定中断概率约束条件下的最大通信速率。还表明，所提出的方案可以利用对于每个子信道仅广播1比特信道状态信息的小信令开销。
