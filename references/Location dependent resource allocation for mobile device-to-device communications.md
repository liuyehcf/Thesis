Device-to-device (D2D) communication as an underlay to future cellular networks has been recently considered as an efficient cell offloading and capacity increasing solution. In this paper, we propose to use the D2D underlay as a carrier for automotive safety applications with very strict quality of service and reliability requirements. We propose a location dependent resource allocation scheme (LDRAS) for mobile D2D communications that fulfills the requirements of such services, while reducing the signaling overhead and guaranteeing a certain maximum interference level within the primary network and the D2D underlay, respectively. The former is ensured by applying persistent resource allocation to the vehicular D2D network. The latter is achieved with a spatial reuse scheme with fixed resource reservation, exploiting the localized nature of vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Initial simulation results, comparing the proposed LDRAS to a state-of-the-art radio resource management algorithm, are provided as a proof-of-concept and illustrate the benefits of our solution.

作为未来蜂窝网络的底层的设备到设备（D2D）通信最近被认为是高效的信元卸载和容量增加解决方案。在本文中，我们建议以非常严格的服务质量和可靠性要求，将D2D底层用作汽车安全应用的载体。我们针对移动D2D通信提出了一种位置相关资源分配方案（LDRAS），可以满足这些业务的要求，同时降低了信令开销，保证了主网络和D2D底层的一定的最大干扰水平。前者通过对车载D2D网络进行持续资源分配来保证。后者是通过固定资源预留的空间复用方案实现的，利用了车辆间通信的本地化特性。最初的仿真结果，将所提出的LDRAS与最先进的无线电资源管理算法进行比较，作为概念证明，并说明了我们解决方案的好处。
