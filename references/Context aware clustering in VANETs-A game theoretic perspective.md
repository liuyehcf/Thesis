This paper focuses on a particular application of coalitional game theory to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET), involving only vehicular-to-vehicular communications. Moreover, networking is performed in an ad hoc basis to pursue full context awareness of vehicles. The proposed approach relies upon the setting up of cluster as soon as convoys temporarily arise in traffic dynamics. First, we define a utility function for each node under the hypothesis of being an ordinary node, cluster head or free node. We further prove that a selfish approach is suboptimal when compared to a game of coalition. Then, the communication between clusters (inter clusters communications) has been implicitly modelled according to this approach. Finally, from the simulation results, it is shown that a coalitional game outperforms a selfish approach for different nodes spatial deployment and mobility patterns.

本文重点研究了联盟博弈理论在车辆自组网（VANET）中的具体应用，仅涉及车对车通信。 此外，网络是在临时的基础上进行的，以追求车辆的全面情境意识。 所提出的方法依赖于在车队暂时出现交通动态时立即建立集群。 首先，在普通节点，簇头或空闲节点的假设下，为每个节点定义一个效用函数。 我们进一步证明，与联盟游戏相比，自私的方式并不理想。 然后，集群之间的通信（集群间通信）已经根据这种方法隐式建模。 最后从仿真结果可以看出，联盟游戏比不同节点的空间部署和移动模式更加自私。 关键词 - VANET; V2V通信，情境意识，动态聚类，博弈论。
